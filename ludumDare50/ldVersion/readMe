Theme: Delay the inevitable


The game wasn't done in 48h,but I really want to submit it as a solo developer. 

My internet is very unstable, so I can only use the webVersion to upload files. that's why you see very nasty zip packages.
After unpacking it is a unity project. Running on version 2020.3.26
